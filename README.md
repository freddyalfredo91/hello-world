*about me* 


I'm a grad student in education. I am curious to learn about as many things as I can to help people. Data science has proven to be a powerful tool in my work and life. I been developing my skills in SQL, GIS, and R programming for education-related research. I also like teaching people what I've learned that could be useful to them and it is a big part of my work in grad school (Participatory research). In general, this is really about how I got here and am always looking forward to my next adventure. it's all about connecting the dots and adapting to new situations. You can see some samples of my familiarity with R in the markdown files I've added to this repo. 

*knowledge is power!* 

learning git and open-source programming is exciting to me because it allows me to access things I wouldn't have imagined when I was younger.
