*about me* 


I'm a grad student in education. I am curious to learn about as many things as I can to help people. Data science has proven to be a powerful tool in my work and life. I am trying to establish my skills in GIS and R for education-related research. I also like teaching people what I've learned that could be useful to them and it is a big part of my work in grad school (Participatory research).

*knowledge is power!* 
learning git and open-source programming is exciting to me because it allows me to access things I could never have dreamt about.
